### Optional Chaining...

The optional chaining (?.) operator accesses an object's property or calls a function. If the object accessed or function called using this operator is undefined or null, the expression short circuits and evaluates to undefined instead of throwing an error.



### map : 

loops through each element of the array and do the operation that you passed in the call-back function and hold the result from each operation in an array and finally returns you array.


## forEach()
The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element but does not create a new array. It is typically used for performing actions on array elements without producing a new array.

## map():

The map() method creates a new array by applying a provided function to each element in the original array and returns the results in a new array. It is used for transforming or mapping array elements.

## filter() & find() :

find() returns the first matching element, while . filter() returns an array of all matching elements. When working with an array in JavaScript, we may need to locate a single item within the collection. This may appear tiresome, but if we apply the right methods/procedures/techniques, it shouldn't be too tough.
