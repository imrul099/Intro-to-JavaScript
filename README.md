c. Prototyped-based.
d. Dynamically- typed.
e. High Abstraction.
f. Garbage Collection.


## Execution Context and Call Stack:
















## Single-threaded

* Single-threaded means only one statement is executed at a time.

* JavaScript only has one call stack.

* JavaScript runs code line by line.

* Must finish executing a peice of code before moving onto the next.



## Async/ Await

* async/await is a special syntax to work with promises in a more comfortable way.

* It's surprisingly easy to understand and use.

* The await keyword can only be used inside an async function.

* The await keyword make the function pause the execution an wait for a resolved promised before it continues.



## setTimeout() vs setInterval()

### setTimeout():
* A time event function used to call another function after certain time period but executes the function only once.


### setInterval():
* Same as setTimeout() with a sloce difference that the execution of the function occurs continuously accourding to the specified time interval. Here, the time interval works like a gap between the executions.


#### clearInterval(), clearTimeout()
