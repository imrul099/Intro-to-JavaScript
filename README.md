## Execution Context and Call Stack:
















## Single-threaded

* Single-threaded means only one statement is executed at a time.

* JavaScript only has one call stack.

* JavaScript runs code line by line.

* Must finish executing a peice of code before moving onto the next.



## Async/ Await

* async/await is a special syntax to work with promises in a more comfortable way.

* The await keyword can only be used inside an async function.

* The await keyword make the function pause the execution an wait for a resolved promised before it continues.
